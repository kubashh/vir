# VIR programming language

## For now not working!

## Lang
Simple language similar to Java, JavaScript and TypeSctipt

### To think
only `var` keyword for declaring variables (comptime oplimalization)

## Steps
1. Program need to compile on developer divice
2. Run on client (client need to have VVM)

# To do

## Impontant
- fix vm.zig (read file error, why given path is diffrent)

## Compiler
- read Main file (/src/Main.vir) and bundle all files together
- remove unused values 
- rename to ptr
- create out file

## VM
- read file that contains compiled code
- parse file
- run file
